def minPath(grid, k):
    
    # The idea is to use a DP table to store the minimum path to each cell.
    # The DP table is a 2D array with the same dimensions as the grid.
    # The DP table is initialized with the first row and first column.
    # The first row and first column are the minimum paths to the first
    # cell of the row and column, respectively.
    # Then, the DP table is filled row by row and column by column.
    # The DP table is filled using the minimum path to the cell above and
    # to the left of the current cell.
    # The minimum path to the current cell is the minimum of the minimum
    # path to the cell above and to the left of the current cell plus the
    # value of the current cell.
    # The minimum path to the last cell is the answer.
    # Time complexity: O(N^2).
    # Space complexity: O(N^2).
    # TODO: implement this.
