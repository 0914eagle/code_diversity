def pairs_sum_to_zero(l):
    
    # return True if there are two distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and False otherwise.
    # Hint: keep track of which numbers have been checked
    # Hint 2: if there are two numbers that sum to zero, they must have the same sign
    # Hint 3: if there are two numbers that sum to zero, their difference must be in the list
    # Hint 4: if there are two numbers that sum to zero, one of them must be zero
    # Hint 5: you can loop through a list in two different orders
    # Hint 6: you can use the list method remove() to mutate a list as you traverse it
    # Hint 7: you can use the list method count() to check how many instances of a value are in a list
    # Hint 8: you can use the list method index() to find the index of the first instance of a value in a list
    # Hint 9: you can use the list method pop() to remove an element at a given index
    # Hint 10: you can use the list method append() to add an element to the end of a list
    # Hint 11: you can use the list method insert() to add an element at a given index
    # Hint 12: you can use the list method sort() to sort a list
    # Hint 13: you can use the list method reverse() to reverse a list
    # Hint 14: you can use the list method copy() to make a copy of a list
    # Hint 15: you can use the list method clear() to empty a list
    # Hint 16: you can use the list method extend() to add a list to the end of a list
    # Hint 17: you can use the list method remove() to remove an element from a list
    # Hint 18: you can use the list method pop() to remove and return an element from a list
    # Hint 19: you can use the list method count() to check how many instances of a value are in a list
    # Hint 20: you can use the list method index() to find the index of the first instance of a value in a list
