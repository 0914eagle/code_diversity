def search(lst):
    '''
    You are given a non-empty list of positive integers. Return the greatest integer that is greater than 
    zero, and has a frequency greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself. 
    The frequency of an integer is the number of times it appears in the list.
    If no such a value exist, return -1.
    Examples:
        search([4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]) == 2
        search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]) == 3
        search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4]) == -1

    # your code here
    # 1. find the max number in the list
    # 2. check if the max number is greater than zero
    # 3. check if the frequency of the max number is greater than or equal to the max number
    # 4. return the max number if the frequency is greater than or equal to the max number
    # 5. return -1 if the frequency is less than the max number
    # 6. return -1 if the max number is less than or equal to zero
    # 7. return -1 if the list is empty
    # 8. return -1 if the list contains only one number
    # 9. return -1 if the list contains only one number and it is less than or equal to zero
    # 10. return -1 if the list contains only one number and it is greater than zero but the frequency is less than the number
    # 11. return -1 if the list contains only one number and it is greater than zero but the frequency is equal to the number
    # 12. return -1 if the list contains only one number and it is greater than zero but the frequency is greater than the number
    # 13. return -1 if the list contains only one number and it is less than zero
