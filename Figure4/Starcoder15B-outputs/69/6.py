def search(lst):
    '''
    You are given a non-empty list of positive integers. Return the greatest integer that is greater than 
    zero, and has a frequency greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself. 
    The frequency of an integer is the number of times it appears in the list.
    If no such a value exist, return -1.
    Examples:
        search([4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]) == 2
        search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]) == 3
        search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4]) == -1

    # Your code here
    # 1. Create a dictionary with the frequency of each number
    # 2. Iterate through the dictionary and find the greatest number that is greater than zero and has a frequency greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself
    # 3. If no such a value exist, return -1.
    # 4. Return the greatest integer that is greater than zero, and has a frequency greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself.
    # 5. Return the greatest integer that is greater than zero, and has a frequency greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself.
    # 6. Return the greatest integer that is greater than zero, and has a frequency greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself.
    # 7. Return the greatest integer that is greater than zero, and has a frequency greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself.
    # 8. Return the greatest integer that is greater than zero, and has a frequency greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself.
    # 9. Return the greatest integer that is greater than zero, and has a frequency greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself.
    # 10. Return the greatest integer that is greater than zero, and has a frequency greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself.
    # 11. Return the greatest integer that is greater than zero, and has a frequency greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself.
    # 12. Return the greatest integer that is greater than zero, and has a frequency greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself.
    # 13. Return the greatest integer that is greater than zero, and has a frequency greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself.
    # 14. Return the greatest integer that is greater than zero, and has a frequency greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself.
    # 15. Return the greatest integer that is greater than zero, and has a frequency greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself.
    # 16. Return the greatest integer that is greater than zero, and has a frequency greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself.
    # 17. Return the greatest integer that is greater than zero, and has a frequency greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself.
