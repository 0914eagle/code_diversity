    # 1. Create a 2D array to store the minimum path of length k
    # 2. Initialize the first row and column to 0
    # 3. Iterate over the grid
    # 4. If the cell is not visited, update the minimum path of length k
    #    by adding the value of the cell to the minimum path of length k
    # 5. If the cell is visited, update the minimum path of length k
    #    by adding the value of the cell to the minimum path of length k
    # 6. Return the minimum path of length k
