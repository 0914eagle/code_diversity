    # Solution 1: Dynamic Programming
    # Time Complexity: O(N^2)
    # Space Complexity: O(N^2)
    #
    # Dynamic Programming:
    # 1. Initialize a 2D array to store the minimum path of length k.
    # 2. Initialize the first row and first column to be 0.
    # 3. Initialize the first cell to be the first cell of the grid.
    # 4. Iterate over the grid.
    #    a. If the cell is not visited, set the minimum path to the current cell.
    #    b. If the cell is visited, set the minimum path to the minimum path of the cell to the left and top.
    #    c. If the cell is visited, set the minimum path to the minimum path of the cell to the right and top.
    #    d. If the cell is visited, set the minimum path to the minimum path of the cell to the left and bottom.
    #    e. If the cell is visited, set the minimum path to the minimum path of the cell to the right and bottom.
    # 5. Return the minimum path of length k.
    #
    # Note:
    # 1. The length of the grid will be in the range [1, 100].
    # 2. The value of each grid cell will be in the range [1, N * N].
    # 3. The value of k will be in the range [1, N * N].
    # 4. The answer will not be the answer to the question.
    # 5. The answer is guaranteed to be unique.

    # Examples:
    # 1. grid = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9] ]
    # 2. k = 3
    # 3. grid = [ [5,9,3], [4,1,6], [7,8,2] ]
    # 4. k = 1
    # 5. grid = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9] ]
    # 6. k = 0
    # 7. grid = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9] ]
    # 8. k =
