    # We need to keep track of the sum of the elements with at most two digits

    # We also need to keep track of the sum of the elements with at most two digits
    # from the first k - 1 elements of arr.
    #
    # We can use the following recurrence relation:
    #
    #     sum_with_two_digits(k) = sum_with_two_digits(k - 1) + sum_with_one_digit(k)
    #
    # where
    #
    #     sum_with_two_digits(k) = sum of the elements with at most two digits from the first k elements of arr
    #     sum_with_one_digit(k) = sum of the elements with at most one digit from the first k elements of arr
    #
    # We can compute sum_with_one_digit(k) using the following recurrence relation:
    #
    #     sum_with_one_digit(k) = sum_with_one_digit(k - 1) + arr[k - 1]
    #
    # We can compute sum_with_two_digits(k) using the following recurrence relation:
    #
    #     sum_with_two_digits(k) = sum_with_two_digits(k - 1) + sum_with_one_digit(k) - arr[k - 1]
    #
    # We can use the following base cases:
    #
    #     sum_with_two_digits(0) = 0
    #     sum_with_one_digit(0) = 0
    #
    # We can compute sum_with_two_digits(k) in O(1) time using a dynamic programming table.
    #
    # We can compute sum_with_one_digit(k) in O(1) time using a dynamic programming table.
