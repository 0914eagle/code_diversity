    # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    # The problem can be solved using dynamic programming.
    # 
    # Let's say we have a grid of size (m x n) and a bucket capacity of k.
    # 
    # We can solve this problem in two steps:
    # 1. Find the maximum number of wells that can be filled using a single bucket.
    # 2. Find the maximum number of wells that can be filled using k buckets.
    # 
    # We can solve the first problem in O(mn) time and space.
    # We can solve the second problem in O(mn) time and space.
    # 
    # The total time complexity of the algorithm will be O(mn).
    # The total space complexity of the algorithm will be O(mn).
