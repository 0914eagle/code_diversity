def minPath(grid, k):
    
    # Time Complexity: O(N*N)
    # Space Complexity: O(N*N)
    # N = number of rows in grid
    # M = number of columns in grid
    # This solution is based on the fact that the grid is a square matrix
    # and the values on the grid are in the range [1, N*N] inclusive.
    # We can use the following observations:
    # 1. The minimum path of length k is the same as the minimum path of length k-1
    #    that visits the cell with the smallest value.
    # 2. The minimum path of length k is the same as the minimum path of length k-1
    #    that visits the cell with the second smallest value.
    # 3. The minimum path of length k is the same as the minimum path of length k-1
    #    that visits the cell with the third smallest value.
    # 4. ...
    # 5. The minimum path of length k is the same as the minimum path of length k-1
    #    that visits the cell with the kth smallest value.
    # 6. The minimum path of length k is the same as the minimum path of length k-1
    #    that visits the cell with the k-1th smallest value.
    # 7. ...
    # 8. The minimum path of length k is the same as the minimum path of length k-1
    #    that visits the cell with the (k-1)th smallest value.
    # 9. ...
    # 10. The minimum path of length k is the same as the minimum path of length k-1
    #     that visits the cell with the (k-2)th smallest value.
    # 11. ...
    # 12. The minimum path of length k is the same as the minimum path of length k-1
    #     that visits the cell with the (k-N)th smallest value.
    # 13. ...
    # 14. The minimum path of length k is the same as the minimum path of length k-1
    #     that visits the cell with the (k-(N-1))th smallest value.
