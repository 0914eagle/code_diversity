def search(lst):
    '''
    You are given a non-empty list of positive integers. Return the greatest integer that is greater than 
    zero, and has a frequency greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself. 
    The frequency of an integer is the number of times it appears in the list.
    If no such a value exist, return -1.
    Examples:
        search([4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]) == 2
        search([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4]) == 3
        search([5, 5, 4, 4, 4]) == -1

    # if the number is greater than 0 and the value is greater than or equal to the number, return the number
    # if no number is greater than 0 and the value is greater than or equal to the number, return -1
    # if the number is greater than 0 and the value is less than the number, return -1
    # if the number is less than 0, return -1
